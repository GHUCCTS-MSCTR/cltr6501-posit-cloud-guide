# Introduction to Posit Cloud for Biostatistics

Welcome to CLTR6501! This comprehensive guide will introduce you to Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud), the platform we'll be using for our R programming and biostatistical analysis tasks throughout the course.

## What is Posit Cloud?

Posit Cloud is a cloud-based version of RStudio, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It allows you to write, run, and share R code directly in your web browser, providing a consistent and accessible environment for statistical computing and data analysis.

## Why Posit Cloud for CLTR6501?

1. **Accessibility**: Access your R projects from any device with an internet connection.
2. **Consistency**: Everyone uses the same R version and package setup, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.
3. **Collaboration**: Easily share projects with instructors and peers for feedback and group work.
4. **Pre-configured Environment**: Course-specific packages and datasets can be pre-loaded.
5. **Cloud Computing**: Leverage cloud resources for computationally intensive biostatistical analyses.

   - Run R commands interactively
   - View output from executed code

3. **Environment/History** (Top-Right):
   - Environment: View and manage your data objects and variables
   - History: See a list of previously executed commands

4. **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (Bottom-Right):
   - Files: Manage project files and directories
   - Plots: View generated plots and graphics
   - Packages: Install and load R packages
   - Help: Access R documentation
   - Viewer: Display web content and HTML widgets

## Running R Code

Let's start with some basic R operations relevant to biostatistics:

```{r basic-operations}
# Basic statistical operations
data <- c(23, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 35, 37, 40)
mean_value <- mean(data)
median_value <- median(data)
sd_value <- sd(data)

cat("Mean:", mean_value, "\n")
cat("Median:", median_value, "\n")
cat("Standard Deviation:", sd_value, "\n")

# Create a simple histogram
hist(data, main = "Distribution of Values", xlab = "Value", col = "lightblue", border = "white")
```

To run code:
1. Type or paste code into the Source Editor
2. Select the code you want to run
3. Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac)

## Installing and Loading Packages

Posit Cloud comes with many packages pre-installed, but you may need to install additional ones:

```{r packages, eval=FALSE}
# Install a package
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load a package
library(ggplot2)

# Check installed packages
installed.packages()[, c("Package", "Version")]
```

## Working with Data in Posit Cloud

### Importing Data

Posit Cloud supports various data import methods:

```{r data-import, eval=FALSE}
# CSV file (replace with actual file path)
data <- read.csv("your_data.csv")

# Excel file (requires readxl package)
library(readxl)
excel_data <- read_excel("your_data.xlsx")

# From URL
url_data <- read.csv("https://example.com/data.csv")
```

### Basic Data Manipulation

Here's an example using the built-in `mtcars` dataset:

```{r data-manipulation}
# Load dplyr for data manipulation
library(dplyr)

# Basic operations on mtcars dataset
mtcars_summary <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_mpg = mean(mpg),
    sd_mpg = sd(mpg),
    count = n()
  )

print(mtcars_summary)

# Visualization with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "MPG Distribution by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon")
```

## Saving and Sharing Your Work

### Saving Projects

- Posit Cloud autosaves your work frequently
- Manually save: File > Save or Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)

### Sharing Projects

1. Click "Share" in the top-right corner of your project
2. Set permissions (View, Edit, or None)
3. Copy the generated link to share

# Advanced Features for Biostatistics

## Using R Markdown for Reports

R Markdown is crucial for creating reproducible reports in biostatistics. Here's a basic example:

```{r rmarkdown-example, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Basic Biostatistics Report"
output: html_document
---

## Data Analysis

We analyze the `mtcars` dataset:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)

# Correlation between mpg and weight
cor.test(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
```

## Visualization

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, 
     main="Car Weight vs. MPG",
     xlab="Weight", ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
```

## Version Control with Git

Posit Cloud supports Git for version control:

1. In your project, go to Tools > Version Control > Project Setup
2. Choose "Git" as the version control system
3. Use the Git pane (top-right) to stage, commit, and push changes

## Computational Performance

For computationally intensive tasks:

1. Increase project resources: Settings > Editor > Resources
2. Use parallel processing packages like `parallel` or `foreach`

# Best Practices for CLTR6501

1. **Organize Your Work**: Use clear file and folder structures
2. **Comment Your Code**: Write explanatory comments for complex operations
3. **Use R Markdown**: Combine code, output, and explanations in one document
4. **Regular Commits**: If using Git, commit changes frequently with meaningful messages
5. **Collaborate Responsibly**: When sharing projects, be mindful of data privacy and code attribution

# Troubleshooting and Support

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Slow Performance**:
   - Close unused projects and browser tabs
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Upgrade your Posit Cloud plan if needed

2. **Package Installation Failures**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you have the latest R version: `R.Version()`
   - Try installing from the Packages pane instead of the console

3. **Project Won't Load**:
   - Try accessing the project in a different browser
   - Contact Posit Cloud support if persistent
